| Question      | Answer |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| SQL file?      |  You don't need an SQL file, if u look here [RivalCore/server/serverDatabase.lua](https://github.com/rival-group/rival-warfare/blob/1eeb15ccc4ad173b196c761cbc7ecebe2c48c417/RivalCore/server/serverDatabase.lua) , but make sure you have created the database. Contents within should make itself  |
| Server CFG   | Just the standard stuff        |
| Build NUI?   | `npm i` then `npm run build`, make sure you are in the RivalNUI directory  |
